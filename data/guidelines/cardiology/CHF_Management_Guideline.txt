CLINICAL GUIDELINE: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF) MANAGEMENT

Based on: American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guidelines

DIAGNOSIS:
- Clinical presentation: dyspnea, fatigue, fluid retention
- Physical exam: elevated JVP, pulmonary rales, peripheral edema
- Diagnostic tests: BNP/NT-proBNP, echocardiography, chest X-ray

CLASSIFICATION:
Stage A: High risk, no structural disease
Stage B: Structural disease, no symptoms
Stage C: Structural disease with symptoms
Stage D: Refractory heart failure

TREATMENT - STAGE C (Symptomatic HF):

First-Line Medications:
1. ACE Inhibitors or ARBs
   - Lisinopril 5-40mg daily
   - Enalapril 2.5-20mg twice daily
   - Losartan 25-100mg daily (if ACE intolerant)

2. Beta Blockers
   - Carvedilol 3.125-25mg twice daily
   - Metoprolol succinate 12.5-200mg daily
   - Bisoprolol 1.25-10mg daily

3. Diuretics (for volume overload)
   - Furosemide 20-240mg daily
   - Bumetanide 0.5-10mg daily
   - Titrate to euvolemia

4. Aldosterone Antagonists (if EF ≤35%)
   - Spironolactone 12.5-25mg daily
   - Monitor potassium and renal function

MONITORING:
- Daily weights
- Fluid restriction (≤2L/day if hyponatremic)
- Sodium restriction (<3g/day)
- Regular follow-up every 1-2 weeks initially
- Adjust medications based on symptoms and labs

RED FLAGS - IMMEDIATE EVALUATION:
- Worsening dyspnea at rest
- Significant weight gain (>2-3 lbs in 24 hours)
- Hypotension with symptoms
- New or worsening renal function
- Electrolyte abnormalities

PATIENT EDUCATION:
- Daily weight monitoring
- Signs of worsening HF
- Medication adherence
- Dietary sodium restriction
- Fluid management

SPECIALIST REFERRAL:
- Stage D heart failure
- Device consideration (ICD, CRT)
- Transplant evaluation
- Refractory symptoms despite optimal therapy
