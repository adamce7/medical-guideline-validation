CLINICAL GUIDELINE: ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) MANAGEMENT

Based on: AHA/ACC STEMI and NSTEMI Guidelines

IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT (First 10 minutes):

1. Aspirin
   - 325mg chewed immediately (non-enteric coated)
   - Continue 81mg daily indefinitely

2. Oxygen
   - Only if SpO2 <90%
   - Target saturation 90-94%

3. Nitroglycerin
   - 0.4mg sublingual every 5 minutes x3
   - Contraindications: hypotension, RV infarct, sildenafil use

4. Morphine
   - 2-4mg IV for chest pain
   - Repeat every 5-15 minutes as needed

5. ECG
   - 12-lead within 10 minutes of arrival
   - Identify STEMI vs NSTEMI

STEMI MANAGEMENT:

Primary PCI (Preferred):
- Door-to-balloon time: <90 minutes
- Immediate cath lab activation

Fibrinolytic Therapy (if PCI not available):
- Door-to-needle time: <30 minutes
- Tenecteplase dose based on weight
- Contraindications: recent surgery, bleeding history, uncontrolled HTN

ANTIPLATELET THERAPY:

Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT):
1. Aspirin 81mg daily (indefinitely)
2. P2Y12 Inhibitor:
   - Clopidogrel 600mg load, then 75mg daily, OR
   - Ticagrelor 180mg load, then 90mg twice daily, OR
   - Prasugrel 60mg load, then 10mg daily
   - Duration: Minimum 12 months

ANTICOAGULATION:
- Heparin IV or Enoxaparin subcutaneous
- During PCI procedure

SECONDARY PREVENTION:

1. High-Intensity Statin
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily OR
   - Rosuvastatin 20-40mg daily
   - Goal LDL <70 mg/dL

2. Beta Blocker
   - Start within 24 hours if stable
   - Continue indefinitely
   - Metoprolol, carvedilol, or bisoprolol

3. ACE Inhibitor or ARB
   - Start within 24 hours if LVEF <40%
   - Consider for all MI patients

RISK STRATIFICATION:
- GRACE score for NSTEMI
- TIMI risk score
- Echocardiography for LVEF assessment

DISCHARGE CRITERIA:
- Hemodynamically stable
- No recurrent ischemia
- Post-PCI observation complete
- Medications optimized
- Patient education completed

FOLLOW-UP:
- Cardiology within 2 weeks
- Cardiac rehabilitation referral
- Repeat echo in 6-8 weeks
