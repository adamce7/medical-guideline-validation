CLINICAL PROTOCOL: SEPSIS AND SEPTIC SHOCK MANAGEMENT

Based on: Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines

SEPSIS DEFINITION:
Life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to infection

RECOGNITION:
qSOFA Score (≥2 suggests sepsis):
- Respiratory rate ≥22/min
- Altered mentation (GCS <15)
- Systolic BP ≤100 mmHg

HOUR-1 BUNDLE (Complete within 1 hour):

1. Measure Lactate Level
   - Obtain baseline lactate
   - Remeasure if initial >2 mmol/L

2. Obtain Blood Cultures
   - Before antibiotics if possible
   - Two sets from different sites
   - Include anaerobic bottles

3. Administer Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics
   - Within 1 hour of recognition
   - Common regimens:
     * Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV q6h PLUS
     * Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h
   - Adjust based on:
     * Source of infection
     * Local resistance patterns
     * Patient allergies

4. Rapid Fluid Resuscitation
   - 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥4
   - Use balanced crystalloids (LR or Plasma-Lyte)
   - Administer within first 3 hours

5. Vasopressors (if hypotensive during/after fluids)
   - Target MAP ≥65 mmHg
   - Norepinephrine first-line (0.05-2 mcg/kg/min)
   - Central line preferred but peripheral acceptable initially

SEPTIC SHOCK MANAGEMENT:

Fluid Refractory Hypotension:
1. Continue IV fluids (assess volume status)
2. Norepinephrine infusion (first-line)
3. Consider vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min as second agent
4. Epinephrine if additional support needed

SOURCE CONTROL:
- Identify and control source within 12 hours
- Remove infected devices
- Drain abscesses
- Surgical intervention if needed

MONITORING:
- Continuous vital signs
- Urine output (goal >0.5 mL/kg/hr)
- Lactate clearance
- Organ function (renal, hepatic, respiratory)
- Mental status

ANTIBIOTIC DURATION:
- Typical course: 7-10 days
- Adjust based on:
  * Clinical response
  * Source control achieved
  * Microbiologic data
- De-escalate based on cultures

RED FLAGS:
- Lactate >4 mmol/L
- SBP <90 mmHg despite fluids
- Altered mental status
- Acute kidney injury
- Respiratory failure

SPECIAL POPULATIONS:

Immunocompromised:
- Broader coverage including fungal
- Consider atypical organisms

Post-surgical:
- Anaerobic coverage essential
- Source control critical

Neutropenic Fever:
- Immediate antibiotics
- Anti-pseudomonal coverage
