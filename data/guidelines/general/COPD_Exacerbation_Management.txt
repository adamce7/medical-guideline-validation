CLINICAL GUIDELINE: COPD EXACERBATION MANAGEMENT

Based on: GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease)

DIAGNOSIS OF EXACERBATION:
Acute worsening of respiratory symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variation:
- Increased dyspnea
- Increased cough frequency
- Increased sputum volume or purulence

SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:

Mild Exacerbation:
- Treated with bronchodilators alone

Moderate Exacerbation:
- Requires antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids

Severe Exacerbation:
- Requires hospitalization or ED visit

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:
- Vital signs (including oxygen saturation)
- Arterial blood gas (if severe)
- Chest X-ray (rule out pneumonia, pneumothorax)
- ECG (rule out cardiac cause)

PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT:

1. Bronchodilators (ALL patients)
   Short-Acting Beta-Agonist (SABA):
   - Albuterol 2.5-5mg nebulized every 4-6 hours
   - Or MDI 2-4 puffs every 4-6 hours

   Short-Acting Anticholinergic:
   - Ipratropium 0.5mg nebulized every 6 hours
   - Or combined albuterol/ipratropium (DuoNeb)

2. Systemic Corticosteroids (Moderate-Severe)
   - Prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days
   - Alternative: Methylprednisolone 125mg IV q6h

3. Antibiotics (if purulent sputum or severe)
   First-line options:
   - Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg PO BID for 5-7 days
   - Doxycycline 100mg PO BID for 5-7 days
   - Azithromycin 500mg day 1, then 250mg daily for 4 days

   Severe/Risk factors:
   - Levofloxacin 750mg daily for 5 days
   - Moxifloxacin 400mg daily for 5 days

OXYGEN THERAPY:
- Target SpO2 88-92%
- Titrate oxygen to target (avoid over-oxygenation)
- Monitor for CO2 retention

NON-INVASIVE VENTILATION (NIV):
Indications:
- pH 7.25-7.35 with PaCO2 >45 mmHg
- Severe dyspnea with accessory muscle use
- Respiratory rate >25/min

Settings:
- IPAP 12-20 cmH2O
- EPAP 4-8 cmH2O
- Titrate based on patient comfort and ABG

INTUBATION CRITERIA:
- pH <7.25
- Worsening mental status
- Cardiovascular instability
- NIV failure or intolerance

DISCHARGE CRITERIA:
- Improvement in symptoms
- Stable on oral/inhaled medications
- Oxygen saturation ≥90% on room air or baseline
- Patient can ambulate
- Home environment adequate

POST-DISCHARGE CARE:
- Follow-up within 4 weeks
- Ensure proper inhaler technique
- Smoking cessation counseling
- Pulmonary rehabilitation referral
- Vaccination status (pneumococcal, influenza)

PREVENTION:
- Smoking cessation (most important)
- Long-acting bronchodilators (LABA/LAMA)
- Inhaled corticosteroids (if frequent exacerbations)
- Vaccinations
- Pulmonary rehabilitation
